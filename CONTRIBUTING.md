## Improvements to the Codebase

We welcome direct contributions to the sendgrid-python code base. Thank you!

### Development Environment

#### Prerequisites

- Python version 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8
- [python_http_client](https://github.com/sendgrid/python-http-client)
- [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography)
- [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)
- [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox)

#### Initial setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python.git
cd sendgrid-python
```

#### Environment Variables

First, get your free Twilio SendGrid account [here](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-python).

Next, update your environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).

```bash
cp .env_sample .env
```

Then edit `.env` and insert your API key.

```bash
# You do not need to do this when using Docker Compose
source .env
```

#### Execute

See the [examples folder](examples) to get started quickly.

If testing from the root directory of this repo, create a new file (e.g. test.py) and replace `import sendgrid` with `from sendgrid import *`

## Understanding the Code Base

- **/examples**
  - Working examples that demonstrate usage.
- **/tests**
  - Currently, we have unit and profiling tests.
- **/sendgrid**
  - The Web API v3 client is `sendgrid.py`, the other files are legacy code for our mail send v2 endpoint.

## Testing

The PR must pass all the tests before it is reviewed.

All test files are in the [`test`](test) directory. For the purposes of contributing to this repo, please update the [`test_sendgrid.py`](test/test_sendgrid.py) file with unit tests as you modify the code.

The integration tests require a Twilio SendGrid mock API in order to execute. We've simplified setting this up using Docker to run the tests. You will just need [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and `make`.

Once these are available, simply execute the Docker test target to run all tests: `make test-docker`. This command can also be used to open an interactive shell into the container where this library is installed. To start a *bash* shell for example, use this command: `command=bash make test-docker`.

## Style Guidelines & Naming Conventions

Generally, we follow the style guidelines as suggested by the official language. However, we ask that you conform to the styles that already exist in the library. If you wish to deviate, please explain your reasoning.

- [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Please run your code through:

- [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes)
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
- [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8)

## Creating a Pull Request

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python

   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd sendgrid-python

   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (of the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

4a. Create tests.

4b. Create or update the example code that demonstrates the functionality of this change to the code.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream main
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description against the `main` branch. All tests must be passing before we will review the PR.

## Code Reviews
If you can, please look at open PRs and review them. Give feedback and help us merge these PRs much faster! If you don't know how, GitHub has some great [information on how to review a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/).
